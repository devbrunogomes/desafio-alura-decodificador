<h2 id="started">üöÄ Project</h2>

Application made to solve one of the challenges of the Oracle training program: ONE. Here, we have a text decoder, which transforms text entered by the user into encrypted text, and can also do the reverse.

In this project, I did think in two important concepts to make this challenge. Mobile First, which did help me to understand the responsivity, and Functional Programming, which was important for my improvement in programming logic
